# Virtual Assistant for Dr. Simo's Medical Office

This project is a real-time virtual assistant designed to streamline appointment management for Dr. Simo's medical office. It allows patients to schedule, update, or cancel appointments using voice commands. The system leverages advanced technologies like speech recognition, natural language processing, and AI-driven intent recognition to provide a seamless user experience.

## Key Features
- **Voice Interaction:** Converts voice input to text and processes user requests efficiently.
- **Natural Language Understanding:** Utilizes LLaMA 3.1 models for intent recognition and data extraction.
- **Database Management:** Handles scheduling, updating, and canceling appointments directly in the database.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for an interactive and accessible web-based UI.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit** for the web application interface.
- **SpeechRecognition** for converting speech to text.
- **Pyttsx3** for text-to-speech responses.
- **LangChain with OllamaLLM** for handling intent recognition and data extraction.
- **Custom Database Module** for managing appointment records.
